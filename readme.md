# Anki HTTP Status Cat

## What is this ?

This is a [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) deck to learn HTTP Status Code using the
funny [HTTP Status Cats](http://httpcats.herokuapp.com/).

## Instructions

You actually only need the `.apkg` file. Download it and then import it in your
Anki application.

I had trouble importing it directly into the Android App. I had to import it in
the desktop app and then synchronize it to my Android device (be sure to check
the *Fetch media on sync* checkbox if you do so).
